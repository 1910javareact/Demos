# Spring
- Java Framework, manage and facilitate the building of enterprise level applications through Inversion of Control achieved with dependency injection.
- Inversion of Control - give up control over making our own objects ( controllers, daos, service layers) we are going to let spring make them.
- Dependency Injection - Spring will take our dependencies, that it already manages and link them together in a process called wiring.
  - Dependency - Some object B that and object A needs to work. 
- Spring makes our controller object A, it also makes our service object B. Object A needs an object B for it to run. Spring through a process called wiring can give its object B to and its object A.
- We configure spring and all of the objects it manages in an xml file. beans.xml
- The objects we let spring manage are called spring beans.
- Benefits of IoC
  - Seperate concerns. 
  - Loosely Coupled Code. (Use ineterfaces to define the behaviour of our spring beans)
  - Code reusability/ avoid code duplication. 
  - Rely on interfaces/contracts/behaviour instead of the implementation. 
- Downsides of IoC
  - Introduce complexity. (It makes it harder for us to think about the problems)
  - Errors, are much harder to trace. Because spring is incharge of making and executing our objects and that requires a ton of object that make up spring. This means stack traces can be hundreds of lines long.
  - We don't have control. You will lose some control you used to have. Most of the time, thats fine, but sometimes it can be a challenge.
